This Project contains a modified version of the MicroPython repository, based on version 1.19.1. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/v1.19.1). It has been modified to include support for the sha512 hash function as part of the firmware build. This is needed to support the use of the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm found in the folder 'src/external_module'. The files in the folder should be able to be used as a library for the MicroPython port for the ESP32, thanks to the changes made in the MicroPython repository. The port itself still needs to be built as outlined by the Readme provided by MicroPython. 

The files found in 'src/dynamic_module' are a work in progress to create the same functionality as a standalone dynamic module that needs no modification of the MicroPython repository.
